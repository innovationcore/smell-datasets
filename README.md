## Introduction

Electronic nose (e-nose) technology is a type of sensory system that mimics the olfactory system of mammals to detect, identify, and quantify odors or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air.

E-noses consist of a combination of chemical sensors, pattern recognition algorithms, and data analysis software that work together to identify and classify different smells. The chemical sensors used in e-noses can detect a wide range of VOCs, including gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and methane, as well as volatile organic compounds like benzene, formaldehyde, and ethanol.

E-noses can be used in a variety of applications, including food and beverage quality control, environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and detection of hazardous chemicals. In the food industry, e-noses are used to ensure product consistency and to detect contaminants or spoilage. In medical applications, e-noses have been used to detect diseases such as lung cancer and diabetes by analyzing the volatile organic compounds in patients' breath. In environmental monitoring, e-noses can detect and identify pollutants in the air, water, and soil.

This repository provides measurement data, data parsers, data visualization, and pretrained models for e-nose applications.

## Raw Data
Raw data is obtained from the [smell.Inspector device using smell.Annotator software](https://smart-nanotubes.com/products/#hardware)

Raw measurements from the Smell Annotator are found in the "raw_data" directory.

Currently, there are 15 different smells, each with multiple samples.

## Dataset Parser
The dataset parser combines the raw files, eliminates unused channels, and prepares a dataset for model training.

Output support has been added to product timeseries datasets.
```
python dataset_gen.py 
```

### Data Visualization
The dataset visualization code implements t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and plots information on a scatter plot.
```
python visual_gen.py 
```
