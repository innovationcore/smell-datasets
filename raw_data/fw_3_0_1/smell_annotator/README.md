# This repo contains data collected using the Smell Inspector device through the Smell Annotator application.
# Device firmware version : 3.0.1
# Date of collection : 03-31-2023

# Data consists of measurements of multiple types of beverages. The names/brands (for reproducibility) are currently encoded in the filenames.

# collection process consisted of two rounds of measurement: 
# 1. Beverages of room temperature (excluding coffee, which was measured hot) were poured in equal volume into identical cups. Samples of various length are were taken, with 3-4 samples collected per beverage. 
# 2. Beverages were refridgerated then measured at cool temperatures. This round of data collection included 1 aditional measurement for each beverage that lasted 3 minutes.

# For both rounds of testing, the device was used to also record data on the ambient collection environment, in this case an office.
